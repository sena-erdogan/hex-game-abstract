In this version of the project, the hex game is an abstract base class that has the following derived classes
- HexVector: The board is represented using an STL vector of STL vectors.
- HexArray1D: The board is represented using a one dimensional dynamic C array.
- HexAdapter: This class takes a template parameter and behaves like an adaptor class just like the stack or queue class of the STL.
